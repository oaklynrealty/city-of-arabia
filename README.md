# Arancia Yards by BEYOND Standalone Landing

This folder contains the standalone landing page build for `Arancia Yards by BEYOND`.

## Final Public URLs

- Final landing link: `https://master-community.oaklynrealty.ae/`
- Final thank-you link: `https://master-community.oaklynrealty.ae/thank-you/`
- Backup landing alias: `https://master-community.oaklynrealty.ae/arancia-yards/`

The final landing URL loads the real tracked landing page and shows a fixed EN/AR segmented language switcher on the page. English and Arabic pages are also generated as hidden noindex internal routes for the switcher loader and should not be used in ads.
